### python_stock_test

The  repository includes some experiemnts toward stock tradings.

The documents show how I transform some ideas into algorithmic projects and applying on real-world tradings.

#### Idea
&emsp;**Document:**

&emsp;&emsp;*TW_stock_attack_method.py*

&emsp;**Right-Angle Attack Method:**

&emsp;&emsp;when all the rolling-window mwan price lines are going up and rank in order (ex: 3-days-mean price > 5-days-mean price), 

&emsp;&emsp;it is a signal to buy the stock.
